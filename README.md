# 💳 Smart Credit Risk Scoring for Underserved Borrowers

A machine learning-powered project designed to build inclusive, alternative credit risk models for individuals with limited or no credit history. This solution supports financial institutions and fintechs in making responsible lending decisions using non-traditional data sources.

---

## 📌 Overview

Traditional credit scoring systems often exclude:
- Freelancers and gig economy workers
- First-time borrowers with no formal credit history
- Underbanked or digitally active users

This project aims to solve this by:
- Leveraging **alternative data** (like transactions, rent, utility bills)
- Applying **machine learning** to predict creditworthiness
- Enhancing **financial inclusion** using explainable AI

## 🔍 Problem Statement

> How can we assess credit risk for individuals who are financially active but lack formal credit records?

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach

✅ Preprocess structured financial and behavioral features  
✅ Train a supervised ML model (e.g., Random Forest)  
✅ Use SHAP for model explainability  
✅ Output interpretable credit scores for decision support
